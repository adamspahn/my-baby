            <h2>Reasons why I love Luma</h2>
            <p>There are endless reasons to list about why I love Luma. Some of which include the fact that since the day I met her she made me a much better person. She brought a side of me that I never thought anyone was capable of getting me to show, but somehow Luma did. I love Luma because she feels like home. I love her because she brings out the best qualities in me. I love her because she is always there for me whenever I need her. I love her because she done so much for me in the time period that i've known her. I love her because she is so sweet and kind and loving and attentive and respectful. I also love her because she cares about me so much and makes me feel valued. She is also my favorite human being on this planet and I dont think anyone will ever be able to replace her, she is one of a kind and she is amazing. I love that she makes me feel safe and I can be myself around her and that I have the connection I would like to have with my future wife with her. I seriously see her being the mother of my children one day and we could raise a family together one day. </p>
